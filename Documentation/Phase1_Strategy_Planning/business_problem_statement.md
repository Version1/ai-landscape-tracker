# Business Problem Statement

## Project: Agentic AI Landscape Tracker

---

## Problem Definition

**Current State:** Team members rely on manual searches and scattered blogs/podcasts to track developments in the Agentic Gen-AI space from key players (Anthropic, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and others).

**Pain Points:**
- The AI landscape moves extremely fast - major announcements happen daily/weekly
- Difficult to keep up with frontier developments across multiple vendors
- No centralized, curated source of truth for the organization
- Missed opportunities to leverage new capabilities or position as thought leaders
- Time wasted on ad-hoc research across disparate sources

---

## Why Does It Matter?

- **Competitive Disadvantage:** Missing key developments means slower adoption of capabilities that could improve delivery efficiency
- **Thought Leadership Gap:** Without systematic tracking, difficult to establish credibility with customers as experts in the space
- **Knowledge Silos:** Individual team members may discover updates but no mechanism to share broadly
- **Strategic Misalignment:** Leadership and delivery teams may have different understanding of what's possible

---

## Opportunity

**Proposed Solution:** A curated, regularly updated web portal (hosted on GitHub Pages) that aggregates and summarizes key developments in the Agentic AI space.

**Target Audience:**
- **Primary:** Developers, Architects
- **Secondary:** All employees
- **External:** Customers (thought leadership/marketing positioning)

**Expected Benefits:**
- Single source of truth for Agentic AI developments
- Reduced time spent on manual research
- Consistent organizational awareness of frontier capabilities
- External-facing asset demonstrating thought leadership

---

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption:** Active usage by target audience
- **Currency:** Updates published within reasonable timeframe of major announcements
- **Coverage:** Key players tracked (Anthropic, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, others)
- **External Value:** Positive feedback from customers/community

---

## Stakeholders

- **Sponsor:** TBD
- **Primary Users:** Developers, Architects
- **Secondary Users:** All employees, Customers
